# VSS-CodeBase 👨‍💻

**Mentorship Submission & Learning Repository**

This repository contains my daily practice code and task submissions. I use this codebase to track my learning progress and submit tasks directly to my mentor.

## 📂 Repository Structure & Naming Convention

I organize my work by keeping the HTML pages in the root and resources in an `assets` folder.

### How to Navigate:
* **HTML Files (Root):** These are the main entry points, numbered sequentially by task (e.g., `1.task.html`, `2.task.html`).
* **Styles & Resources:** Located in the `assets/` directory.
* **Mapping:** The number on the HTML file corresponds to the number on the CSS file inside `assets/css/`.

**Example:**
* `2.login.html` (Root) ↔️ links to `assets/css/2.style.css`
