# VSS-CodeBase 👨‍💻

**Mentorship Submission & Learning Repository**

This repository tracks my learning progress and daily task submissions. It is organized by **topic**, allowing for clear separation of different technologies as I master them.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is divided into **Topic Modules**. Currently, the active module is **CSS**.

### Folder Hierarchy:
1.  **Main Topic Folder:** (e.g., `CSS/`) Contains all work related to that technology.
2.  **Task Files:** Numbered HTML files located directly inside the topic folder.
3.  **Assets:** A dedicated `assets` folder inside the topic folder holds styles, images, and scripts.

**Example:**
* `2.login.html` (Root) ↔️ links to `assets/css/2.style.css`
